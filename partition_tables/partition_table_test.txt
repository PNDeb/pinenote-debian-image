# comments start with the # character
# also see prepare_gpt_table_rkd.py for parsing output from parted to generate
# a partition table line
# each partition is defined by [size]@[start sector]([name]:[optional flags])
# sector size is 512 bytes
# optional flags are:
#   - bootable -> sets the legacy_boot flag, the first partition with this flag
#     will be searched for the extlinux.conf file
#   - grow -> partition will be grown to the end (?, untested)
